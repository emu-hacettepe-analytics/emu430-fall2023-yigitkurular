# Assignment 1

My first assignment has three parts.

## b) Differences betwwen R and Python

### Indexing Elements

One of the main difference between these two popular languages is indexing the elements. R uses 1 as base index number, but in python indexing starts with 0.

For example:

```{r}
# In R
a <- c(4, 5, 6, 7)
first_a <- a[1]
second_a <- a[2]
print(first_a)
print(second_a)
```

```{python}
# In Python
b = [4, 5, 6, 7]
first_b = b[0]
second_b = b[1]
print(first_b)
print(second_b)
```
